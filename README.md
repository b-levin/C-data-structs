# C Data Structures

A library of data structures for the C language. All of the data structures use ints for the type of variable being stored (might switch to generics `void *`).

## Instructions;

Run `make` from the root of the directory to compile. The `./main` command runs examples of the data structures being used.

## In progress:

* Singularly linked list

## TODO:

* Doubly linked list
* Array list
* Binary Tree
* Hash Map
* Stack
* Queue
* Heap
* Priority Queue
* Graphs
